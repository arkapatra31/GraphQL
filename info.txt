I'm using GraphQL with Node.js
Hence it's neccessary that Node is installed in your system.
Secondly in the base folder post node installation please use the command 'npm init' to generate the necessary project packages which are already included in the project here.
Thirdly you will need to install babel-node, nodemon and other neccessary modules for fluent working of the project.
